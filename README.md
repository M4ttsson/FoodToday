# FoodToday

My first repo on github and mostly created just to learn git and how to use github.

FoodToday is an applikation to keep your best recipes in order on your computer instead of post-it notes somewhere.
And also to give you some inspiration of what you could make for dinner today.

Uses Moq and NUnit for testing purposes.
